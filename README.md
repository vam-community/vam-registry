## Why

Using GitHub to manage the registry offers multiple guarantees:

- Your privacy is protected, since no one can see who access GitHub;
- A minimum level of quality, since everything will be approved and there's a small barrier to entry, preventing abuse;
- Excellent performance and uptime provided by GitHub servers;
- Zero cost for the registry maintainers (except the time to maintain it).
